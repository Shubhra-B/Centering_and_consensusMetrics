**Input**: A "normalised" RNAseq quantification.

**Options**:
Find the Mean Absolute deviation for "n" number of genes as specified by user and center the matrix.
Use the centered matrix to consensus cluster samples based on pItem (proportion of samples being randomly sampled) varying from 0.6 to 0.8


**Output**: A centered matrix and consensus cluster with varying pItem
